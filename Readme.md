# Express API template
This is a project I started almost a year ago when I was willing to experiment with NodeJS. Now I am pusblishing it with the idea of creating incrementaly a template for apis. I will be modifying it as frecuently as possible until it gets more mature and useful.

## Run the app

1- npm install

2- node app

## Run the tests

Just type **npm test**
